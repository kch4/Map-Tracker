========================
Built by **Andrea De Oliveira** and **Kathleen Hu**

A simple Google Maps Android API v2 Demo app. This app helps us test if we have the play services properly setup and allows us to flag locations with titles and descriptions. For detailed installation instructions, check [this Maps guide](https://github.com/thecodepath/android_guides/wiki/Google-Maps-Fragment-Guide)

Make sure that you've setup your Android API key (com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY) in manifests/AndroidManifest.xml!  Otherwise, you may not find the maps rendering.
